## Current Progress
At the moment you are able to create and save the stats of creatures and such by using a UI. The stats are saved as json-files.

## What's next?
The next obviouse step is to make it possible to load the stats from the json-files in a sensible way. Also displaying those stats in a user friendly way would be a pluspoint
