## Current Progress
At the moment you are able to create and save the stats of creatures and such by using a UI. The stats are saved as json-files. You can also roll dice. The die is configurable by choosing the number of siedes. Previouse rolls are displayed as a set of lables. The list of roll results is limited and operates by FIFO.

## What's next?
The next obviouse step is to make it possible to load the stats from the json-files in a sensible way. Also displaying those stats in a user friendly way would be a pluspoint. 

My aspirations for the dice roller are to someday be able to connect multiple dice roller instances (for the players)  to then send the results to a server (Game Master). Those should then be able to be displayed with the corresponding name.

Another pressing matter is the optimization of the UI because I don't know sh** about UI programming
